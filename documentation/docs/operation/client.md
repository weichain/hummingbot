# The Hummingbot Client

Hummingbot uses a command-line interface (CLI) that helps users configure and run the bot, as well as generate logs of the trades performed.

## Starting Hummingbot

### Installed from Docker

Creating a new instance of Hummingbot with `docker run` will automatically start the Hummingbot client (see Docker installation guides for [Windows](/installation/windows) and [MacOS](/installation/macOS)).

To run a previously created, stopped container where $NAME is the name of your instance of Hummingbot:

```sh
docker start $NAME && docker attach $NAME
```

For additional information on useful commands, see the [cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/docker) to running Hummingbot on Docker.

### Installed from Source

!!! note
    Make sure that you activate the Anaconda environment with `conda activate hummingbot` prior to running Hummingbot.

Open a Terminal window and go to the root of the directory that contains Hummingbot. From there, run:
```
bin/hummingbot.py
```

## User Interface

### Client Layout

* **Log pane (right)**: log messages
